## Why FACT?

Firmware analysis can be used to achieve several interesting goals.
Chief among those are identifying functionality, components and potential security weaknesses in black box firmware.

The Firmware Analysis and Comparison Tool (FACT) is intended to automate as much as possible of the manual firmware
analysis work.
FACT combines a growing set of powerful analyses to create a unified interface that brings the user from an arbitrary
firmware sample to a finished analysis.
Some of the key features of the FACT analysis, is that results are

- browsable
- searchable
- and comparable.

Furthermore, FACT offers multiple ways of navigating and visualizing analysis results and firmware contents for easy accessibility.
The main FACT interface is a html/js/css-based web Interface that can be hosted locally or shared through the network.
In addition, FACT offers a REST-like HTTP API that can be explored with an integrated SwaggerUI.
Some key features of the web interface are:

- Easy visualization of firmware by a file tree rendering of all firmware components.
- Quick navigation of analysis results by observing summaries of results over all firmware components.
- Highlighting of relevant analysis results as tags on top of each page.
- Various download options for firmware and components to jump into advanced analysis.

While FACT is maintained as a research prototype, the project is well tested, includes a baseline of documentation and
offers a multitude of production level features.
We're always looking for feedback and feature requests.

More details and some screenshots can be found on our [project page](https://fkie-cad.github.io/FACT_core/).

## Setup

### Requirements

FACT is designed as a multiprocess application, the more Cores and RAM, the better.

| Minimal          | Recommended       |
|------------------|-------------------|
| 4 Cores          | 16 Cores          |
| 8 GB RAM         | 64 GB RAM         |
| 10 GB disk space | 10* GB disk space |

> [!NOTE]
> About 10 GB required to set up FACT code, container, and binaries.
> Additional space is necessary for storage of unpacked files and analysis results.
> This can be on a separate partition or drive.

### Local Installation

It's principally possible to install FACT on any Linux distribution, but the installer is limited to

- Debian 11/12 (stable)
- Ubuntu 20.04/22.04/24.04 (stable)
- Linux Mint 20/21/22 (stable)
- Kali (experimental)

FACT requires Python 3.9â€“3.12 (should be the default in all distributions except Ubuntu 20.04 where you can install
a newer version using `apt`)

The setup process is mostly automated and wrapped in a single script.
Some features can be selected specifically though.
For a detailed guide on how to install FACT see
[INSTALL.md](https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note that while making extensive use of containers, FACT still contains many dependencies
> (and there is no _uninstall_ provided).
> If you want to keep your system clean, you can try one of the setup options provided in the following.

### Vagrant

We provide monthly and ready-to-use vagrant boxes of our master branch.
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is an easy and convenient way to get started with FACT without having to install
it on your machine.
Just setup vagrant and import our provided box into VirtualBox.
Our boxes can be found [here](https://app.vagrantup.com/fact-cad/boxes/FACT-master)!

Check out on how to get started with FACT and vagrant in
our [tutorial](https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core/blob/master/INSTALL.vagrant.md).

### Docker

There is also a dockerized version, but it is currently unmaintained.
(see the [FACT_docker](https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_docker) repo for more information).

## Usage

You can start FACT by executing the `start_fact.py` script.
The script detects all installed components automatically.

```sh
src/start_fact.py
```

Afterward, FACT can be accessed on <http://localhost:5000> (default) or <https://localhost> (if FACT is installed with
nginx).

You can shut down the system by pressing <kbd>Ctrl + c</kbd> or by sending a SIGTERM to the `start_fact.py` script.

> [!CAUTION]
> FACT is not intended to be used as a public internet service.
> The web interface is not a hardened application.
> We try to keep security issues limited by applying SecDevOps but FACT may still offer vulnerabilities.
> Make sure to reset all passwords in the fact configuration if planning to host FACT on not-fully trusted networks.

## Documentation

> [!TIP]
> More documentation on how to use FACT can be found on
our [wiki pages](https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core/wiki/).

Our Sphinx documentation can be found [here](https://fkie-cad.github.io/FACT_core/).

Information on what FACT is and how it works can also be found in the slides in the
[`docs` folder](https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core/tree/master/docs).

### REST API

FACT provides a REST API. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core/wiki/Rest-API).

### User Management

FACT provides an optional basic authentication, role, and user management.
More information can be found [here](https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core/wiki/Authentication).

## Contributing

The easiest way to contribute is writing your own plugin.
Our Developer Manual can be found [here](https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core/wiki/).

## Additional plugins

Currently available additional plugins:

- [Codescanner](https://github.com/fkie-cad/Codescanner_FACT_plugin) (:warning: different license)
    - Classification of segments (e.g. ascii / code / high entropy) in arbitrary binaries
    - Classification of cpu architecture in code segments

## Analysis Import / Export

The script `src/firmware_import_export.py` can be used to export unpacked files and analysis results and import them
into another FACT instance.
The data is stored as a ZIP archive, and this is also the format the script expects during import.
To export files and analysis data of analyzed firmware images, run

```shell
python3 firmware_import_export.py export FW_UID [FW_UID_2 ...] [-o OUTPUT_DIR]
```

> [!NOTE]
> The exported archives can take up significant disk space.
> There is no fixed relation, but it can surpass the size of the original firmware by a factor of 2 - 10.

After this, you can import the exported files with

```shell
python3 firmware_import_export.py import FW.zip [FW_2.zip ...]
```
