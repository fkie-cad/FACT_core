The Firmware Analysis and Comparison Tool (formerly known as Fraunhofer's Firmware Analysis Framework (FAF)) is intended to automate most of the firmware analysis process. 
It unpacks arbitrary firmware files and processes several analysis.
Additionally, it can compare several images or single files.  
Furthermore, Unpacking, analysis and compares are based on plug-ins guaranteeing maximal flexibility and expandability.  
More details and some screenshots can be found on our [project page](https://fkie-cad.github.io/FACT_core/).

## Requirements

FACT is designed as a multiprocess application, the more Cores and RAM, the better.

Minimal | Recommended | Software
------- | ----------- | --------
4 Cores<br>8GB RAM<br>10 GB disk space | 16 Cores<br>64GB RAM<br>10* GB disk space | git<br>python 3.5 - 3.7<br>OS see below

> ~ 10 GB required to set up FACT code, container and binaries. Additional space is necessary for result storage. That can be on a seperate partition or drive.

It is possible to install FACT on any Linux distribution but the installer is limited to
- Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 (stable)
- Ubuntu 19.04 (experimental)
- Debian 9, 10 (experimental)
- Kali (tested on 2019.3 and 2019.4) (experimental)

:exclamation: **Caution: FACT is not intended to be used as public internet service. The GUI is not a hardened WEB-application and it may take your server at risk!**

## Installation

The installation is generally wrapped in a single script. Some features can be selected specifically though.
See [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for details.

## Usage
You can start FACT by executing the *start_all_installed_fact_components* scripts.
The script detects all installed components automatically.

```sh
$ ./start_all_installed_fact_components
```

Afterwards FACT can be accessed on <http://localhost:5000> and <https://localhost> (nginx), respectively.  

You can shutdown the system by pressing *Ctrl + c* or by sending a SIGTERM to the *start_all_installed_faf_components* script.

## Advanced Usage

:fire: We're currently working to improving our documentation, including installation, getting started and alike. Follow progess on our [wiki pages](https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core/wiki/). :v:
