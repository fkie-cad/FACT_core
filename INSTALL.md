# FACT Installation

FACT consists of three components: frontend, database and backend. All components can be installed on one machine as well as on different machines.
There is an automated installation program supporting Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 host systems.  
:exclamation: **The automated installation scipt might remove some packages of your ubuntu installation. In some cases FACT relies on newer versions of a software and replaces the old versions provided by the ubuntu repositories.**

## TL;DR
Execute the following commands as user (not `root`!). 
```sh
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade && sudo apt install git
$ git clone https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core.git ~/FACT_core
$ ~/FACT_core/src/install/pre_install.sh && sudo mkdir /media/data && sudo chown -R $USER /media/data
$ sudo reboot
$ ~/FACT_core/src/install.py
$ ~/FACT_core/start_all_installed_fact_components
```
Wait a few seconds, open your browser and go to `localhost:5000`  
Use `Ctrl + c` in your terminal to shutdown FACT.

## Simple One System Setup

### Pre-Install

Some components of FACT depend on docker. Since a restart is necessary before docker can run. The system has to be rebooted in between FACT installation. Thus the docker setup and some auxiliary stuff has been moved to the `pre_install.sh` script.

The following lines will handle the first half of the installation (based on git not tarball):

```sh
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade && sudo apt install git
$ git clone https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core.git
$ cd FACT_core
$ src/install/pre_install.sh
```

Now modify *src/config/main.cfg* and *src/config/mongod.conf* to suit your needs.
Especially, you should change the mongo passwords.
The database is initialized with these passwords on first start.  

Create the mongo data directory specified in *mongod.conf* and the firmware_file_storage_directory defined in *main.cfg*.
Make sure that the log directory exists as well.

If you have any additional plug-ins, copy/clone them into corresponding *src/plugins/* directory.  

:exclamation: **Reboot before executing the src/install.py** :exclamation:
:exclamation: **You have to do the above steps before you do anything else** :exclamation:

### Main-Install

:customs: **The installation script installs a lot of dependencies that may have different licenses**
  
After reboot, enter the FACT_core directory and execute:  

```sh
$ src/install.py
```

:beer: **Get a drink... Installation of the dependencies might take some time...** :tea:

More advanced setup options can be viewed using the help function of the installer `$ src/install.py --help` and are explained in some detailed in the following paragraphs.

## Multi system setup (**--backend**, **--frontend**, **--db**)

The three components db, backend and frontend can be installed independently to create a distributed installation.

The two worker components (frontend, backend) communicate exclusively through the database. The database in turn does not needed any knowledge of its place in the network, other than on which **ip:port** combination the database server has to be hosted.
The main.cfg on the frontend system has to be altered so that the values of `data_storage.mongo_server` and `data_storage.mongo_port` match the **ip:port** for the database.
The same has to be done for the backend. In addition, since the raw firmware and file binaries are stored in the backend, the `data_storage.firmware_file_storage_directory` has to be created (by default `/media/data/fact_fw_data`).
On the database system, the `mongod.conf` has to be given the correct `net.bindIp` and `net.port`. In addition the path in `storage.dbPath` of the `mongod.conf` has to be created. 

## Installation with Nginx (**--nginx**)

The installer supports automated installation and configuration of nginx.
This will enable a ssl protected access to the frontend via port 443. 
Simply add the *-N* option to activate nginx support.
See our [radare wiki page](https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core/wiki/radare-integration) for some additional steps to allow forwarding of the radare webUI.

## Install Statistic Generation Cron Job (**--statistic_cronjob**)

FACT provides statistics generated by triggering the *update_statistic* script. The install script can add a cronjob to trigger this script once an hour.
Just add the *-U* option on install.

## Installation with/without radare (**--no_radare**)

In contrast to nginx, radare has to be deselected as it is installed by default. This can be done with the `-R` parameter. On additional notes regarding the setup of the radare binding see the extensive notes in the [wiki](https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core/wiki/radare-integration).

## Update an older Installation

Simply checkout the new sources, re-run the `src/install/pre_install.sh` and then `src/install.py`. Rebooting is not necessary if docker is already present.
For tarball installations, the easiest way is to backup the config files, remove the FACT folder, extract the new one and put the configuration back in. Then also re-run `src/install/pre_install.sh` and `src/install.py`.
