# FACT Installation

FACT consists of three components: frontend, database and backend.
All components can be installed on one machine as well as on different machines.
There is an automated installation program supporting Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 host systems.
:exclamation: **The automated installation script might remove some packages of your ubuntu installation. In some cases
FACT relies on newer versions of a software and replaces the old versions provided by the ubuntu repositories.**

## TL;DR
Execute the following commands as user (not `root`!).
```sh
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade && sudo apt install git
$ git clone https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core.git ~/FACT_core
$ ~/FACT_core/src/install/pre_install.sh && sudo mkdir /media/data && sudo chown -R $USER /media/data
```
### WSL only
To make sure that docker starts when you login to a WSL machine, follow the instructions on this webpage

https://blog.nillsf.com/index.php/2020/06/29/how-to-automatically-start-the-docker-daemon-on-wsl2/

Then continue with the regular installation

```sh
$ sudo reboot
$ ~/FACT_core/src/install.py
$ ~/FACT_core/start_all_installed_fact_components
```
Wait a few seconds, open your browser and go to `localhost:5000`
Use `Ctrl + c` in your terminal to shutdown FACT.

## Simple One System Setup

### Pre-Install

Some components of FACT depend on docker.
Since a restart is necessary before docker can run.
The system has to be rebooted in between FACT installation.
Thus the docker setup and some auxiliary stuff has been moved to the `pre_install.sh` script.

The following lines will handle the first half of the installation (based on git not tarball):

```sh
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade && sudo apt install git
$ git clone https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core.git
$ cd FACT_core
$ src/install/pre_install.sh
```

Now modify `src/config/fact-core-config.toml` to suit your needs.
Especially, you should change the postgres passwords.
The database is initialized with these passwords on first start.

Create the `firmware_file_storage_directory` defined in `fact-core-config.toml`.
Make sure that the log directory exists as well.

If you have any additional plug-ins, copy/clone them into corresponding `src/plugins/` directory.

:exclamation: **Reboot before executing the src/install.py** :exclamation:
:exclamation: **You have to do the above steps before you do anything else** :exclamation:

### Main-Install

:customs: **The installation script installs a lot of dependencies that may have different licenses**
After reboot, enter the FACT_core directory and execute:

```sh
$ src/install.py
```

:beer: **Get a drink... Installation of the dependencies might take some time...** :tea:

More advanced setup options can be viewed using the help function of the installer `$ src/install.py --help` and are explained in some detailed in the following paragraphs.

If the environment variable `FACT_INSTALLER_SKIP_DOCKER` is set the installer
will skip all pulling/building of docker images.
This is primarily used for the docker container of FACT but can also be used to
save some time when you already have the images.

## Multi system setup (**--backend**, **--frontend**, **--db**)

The three components db, backend and frontend can be installed independently to create a distributed installation.

The two worker components (frontend, backend) communicate exclusively through the database.
The database in turn does not needed any knowledge of its place in the network, other than on which **ip:port** combination the database server has to be hosted.
The config on the frontend system has to be altered so that the values of `common.postgres.server` and `common.postgres.port` match the **ip:port** for the database.
The same has to be done for the backend.
In addition, since the raw firmware and file binaries are stored in the backend, the `backend.firmware-file-storage-directory` has to be created (by default `/media/data/fact_fw_data`).

## Installation with Nginx (**--nginx**)

The installer supports automated installation and configuration of nginx.
This will enable a ssl protected access to the frontend via port 443.
Simply add the *-N* option to activate nginx support.
See our [radare wiki page](https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core/wiki/radare-integration) for some additional steps to allow forwarding of the radare webUI.

## Install Statistic Generation Cron Job (**--statistic_cronjob**)

FACT provides statistics generated by triggering the *update_statistic* script.
The install script can add a cronjob to trigger this script once an hour.
Just add the *-U* option on install.

## Installation with/without radare (**--no_radare**)

In contrast to nginx, radare has to be deselected as it is installed by default.
This can be done with the `-R` parameter.
On additional notes regarding the setup of the radare binding see the extensive notes in the [wiki](https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core/wiki/radare-integration).

## Update an older Installation

Simply checkout the new sources, re-run the `src/install/pre_install.sh` and then `src/install.py`.
Rebooting is not necessary if docker is already present.
For tarball installations, the easiest way is to backup the config files, remove the FACT folder, extract the new one and put the configuration back in.
Then also re-run `src/install/pre_install.sh` and `src/install.py`.

If your FACT installation is v3.2 or lower and you use authentification then you have to migrate the user database.
To do so simply run the [migrate_database.py](src/migrate_database.py) script.

## FACT and your HTTP Proxy

In some advanced network setups, you might need to configure an http proxy for internet connectivity.
Most components of FACT do not require internet access during runtime.
The [hashlookup](https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core/blob/master/src/plugins/analysis/hashlookup/code/hashlookup.py) plugin, which polls [https://hashlookup.circl.lu/](https://hashlookup.circl.lu/) during analysis, is an exemplary exception.

However, FACTs **installation routine** requires a lot of internet I/O, ranging from fetching APT packages, over static assets from CDNs using `curl` or `wget`, to docker image builds.
Thus, it is important to properly configure your system.
Below, you will find some hints for system-wide proxy configuration.

### Proxy Environment variables

Most dependencies and tools used by FACT honor `*_PROXY` environment variables.
You can set these on a system-wide scope inside `/etc/environment`.


```sh
$ echo 'HTTP_PROXY=http://<YOUR-PROXY-HERE>:<PORT>/
HTTPS_PROXY=http://<YOUR-PROXY-HERE>:<PORT>/
http_proxy=http://<YOUR-PROXY-HERE>:<PORT>/
https_proxy=http://<YOUR-PROXY-HERE>:<PORT>/
no_proxy="localhost,127.0.0.1,::1"
NO_PROXY="localhost,127.0.0.1,::1"' | sudo tee -a /etc/environment
```

### APT

`apt` is usually called via `sudo` in our installation scripts.
While `apt` honors the previously set `*_PROXY` environment variables, `sudo` is configured on some distributions to drop them upon privilege elevation.
You have two options to fix this issue.


**Option 1:** Configure `sudo` to not drop these variables:

```sh
$ sudo visudo  # open the sudoers file and append the following line:
Defaults env_keep += "ftp_proxy http_proxy https_proxy no_proxy"
```

**Option 2:** Directly configure `apt` to use those env vars:

```sh
$ echo 'Acquire::http::Proxy "http://<YOUR-PROXY-HERE>:<PORT>/";
Acquire::https::Proxy "http://<YOUR-PROXY-HERE>:<PORT>/";' | sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/00proxy
```

### Docker

Please refer to the [official docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/network/proxy/) to configure it for proxy usage.
